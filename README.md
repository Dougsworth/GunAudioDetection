# üéØ GunDetection Audio

GunDetection Audio is a modern web-based platform that simulates real-time gunshot detection using audio analysis and map visualization. This project was rebuilt using **Next.js** and focuses on frontend development, improving user experience through smooth animations and real-time interactivity. Originally based on the award-winning [GunShotDetector](https://github.com/RizPur/GunShotDetector), this project demonstrates how sound data can be processed and visualized for security and safety purposes.

## üöÄ Features

- **Real-time Audio Recording**: Users can record audio directly from the browser to simulate real-time sound analysis.
- **Simulated Gunshot Detection**: For demo purposes, the system simulates gunshot detection and instantly provides feedback.
- **Interactive Map**: Detected gunshot locations are visualized on a dynamic map using **React Leaflet**.
- **Smooth Animations**: **Framer Motion** is used for interactive animations that enhance the user experience.
- **Mobile-Responsive Design**: The app is designed to work seamlessly across different devices.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies

- **Next.js**: Rebuilt with Next.js for server-side rendering and API routes.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Provides modern and responsive styling.
- **Framer Motion**: Adds animations and interactive transitions.
- **React Leaflet**: For map rendering and gunshot location visualization.
- **Headless UI**: Used for modals and interactive components.
  
## üí° Inspiration: [GunShotDetector](https://github.com/RizPur/GunShotDetector)

The original **GunShotDetector** project won the **JAIA Hackathon 2023** and featured machine learning models to detect and classify gunshots. The original tech stack involved:

- **Machine Learning Models**: Used CNN for classifying gunshot audio.
- **Backend**: Built with **Django** to manage real-time communications and data handling.
- **Frontend**: The original frontend was built with **React** and **Leaflet** for map visualizations.

This version of **GunDetection Audio** retains the core frontend features while simulating the detection process, and it‚Äôs built with **Next.js** for a smoother development experience.
